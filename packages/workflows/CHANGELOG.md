# @frontal-labs/workflows

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- Relicense all packages under Apache-2.0 (previously MIT).
- Updated dependencies
  - @frontal-labs/core@1.0.4

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- Publish `@frontal-labs/core` as a shared, public dependency instead of bundling
  it into each package. Previously core's runtime was bundled but its type
  declarations still imported `@frontal-labs/core`, which was unpublished — so
  consumers hit `Cannot find module '@frontal-labs/core'`. Core is now a normal
  dependency of every package, so both runtime and types resolve under any
  package manager (npm/pnpm/yarn/bun) and runtime, and the `@frontal-labs/sdk`
  umbrella shares one `FrontalClient` type across sub-packages.
- Updated dependencies
  - @frontal-labs/core@1.0.3

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Bundle `@frontal-labs/core` into the published JS output instead of leaving it as an external dependency. Replace `workspace:*` protocol with proper `^` semver ranges so packages can be installed from npm without errors.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- ca0a261: Close remaining coverage gaps against the spec.

  - **graph**: add `bulkRead` (`/ontology/graph/graph/bulk-read`), relationship
    `getRelationship`/`updateRelationship` (`/ontology/graph/relationships/{id}`),
    async `run(runId)` status, and `capabilities`/`health`/`info`.
  - **workflows**: add `executionSummary` (`/v1/workflows/{id}/{run}/summary`).

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [ca0a261]
  - @frontal-labs/core@1.0.2

## 0.0.1

### Patch Changes

- Initial public release. Build system refactored: composite TypeScript project
  references enabled across all packages, type declarations generated via tsc,
  npm provenance configured, GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline with Changesets
  integration.
- Updated dependencies
  - @frontal-labs/core@1.0.1
